# NCAA APR Analysis

A data science project exploring how NCAA student-athletes perform academically based on their sport, division, and school type (e.g., public/private, HBCU), using the APR (Academic Progress Rate) metric.

## Dataset

Source: [NCAA APR 2019 Public Dataset](https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/research/academics/2020RES_APR2019PubDataShare.csv)

Includes:
- School name
- Sport
- NCAA division
- Public/private status
- HBCU designation
- APR score (out of 1000)

## Research Questions

- Do some sports have lower APR scores due to time demands or revenue focus?
- Are there APR differences across public vs private schools?
- Is there a pattern between HBCU status and APR scores?

## Methods

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Seaborn
- Logistic regression and statistical testing with Statsmodels
- Data visualizations to explore trends
